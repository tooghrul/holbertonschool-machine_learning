    Update the weights and biases of a neural network using gradient descent
    with L2 regularization.

    Args:
        Y: One-hot numpy.ndarray of shape (classes, m) containing correct
           labels for the data
        weights: Dictionary of the weights and biases of the neural network

        alpha: The learning rate
        lambtha: The L2 regularization parameter
        L: The number of layers of the network

    The neural network uses tanh activations on each layer except the last,
    which uses a softmax activation. The weights and biases are updated
    in place.
