    Normalizes an unactivated output of a NN using batch normalization.

    - Z: numpy.ndarray of shape (m, n) to normalize
         m is the number of data points

    - gamma: numpy.ndarray of shape (1, n) containing the scales
    - beta: numpy.ndarray of shape (1, n) containing the offsets
    - epsilon: small number to avoid division by zero
